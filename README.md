# Multilingual-and-Multimodal-COVID-19-Fake-News-Dataset : Binary Classification Problem
## **Learning Planet Institue Project**
The materials belong entirely to Learning Planet Institute. Also, the COVID19 dataset, published by Cornell University. The answers are the only things that show my trials and is available in the report and notebook.



## **Course Objectives:**
The COVID-19 epidemic is considered as the global health crisis of the whole society and the greatest challenge mankind faced since World War Two. Unfortunately, the fake news about COVID-19 is spreading as fast as the virus itself.

To help better combat the COVID-19 fake news, Cornell University through its students (Yichuan Li, Bohan Jiang, Kai Shu, Huan Liu) propose a new fake news detection dataset MM-COVID(Multilingual and Multidimensional COVID-19 Fake News Data Repository). 

Overall,we note 6 different languages; setting up from English, Spanish, Portuguese, Hindi, French to Italian.



1- Download and prepare the datasets provided by Cornell University. Since the dataset is in Json Format, it must be parsed in order to reduce it to flatten pandas dataFrame. 

2- Apply the EDA procedure to describe the dataset characteristics.

3- Describe clearly the procedure used to learn, validate and test your machine learning models and the data prepared in the
previous step.

4- Build a baseline model using logistic regression.

5- Build a model using pre-trained Deep Learning : at choice

6- Discussion: criticize the approach taken (biases, limitations, ...)
